# Employee Attrition Project

Employee attrition refers to the situation where employees naturally or voluntarily leave a company.

Employee attrition if not checked can cost companies a reduction in production, loss of time

and money in building or employing another person to match the employee who left the company.

It, therefore, necessitates companies that are experiencing quite a high rate of employee attrition to

avoid it or reduce its rate by digging deep into matters to find out why employees leave, what are the causes,

which employees are likely to leave the company? 

In this project, machine learning and data science methodologies are applied to build a solution for an anonymous company
that is facing  an employee attrition problem.

## Project Objectives

    1. To find what kind of employees usually leave the company.

    2. Predict which employee is likely to leave the company.
    
## Solution Steps

   1. Data gathering

   2. Data importation

   3. Data Wrangling

   4. Feature Engineering

   5. Descriptive and prescriptive Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)

   6. Machine learning Model implementation
